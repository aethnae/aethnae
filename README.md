### Hi, I'm Johann 👋

I'm a student and photographer from Berlin, Germany 🐻. I spend a lot of time with reading and [photography 📸](https://www.instagram.com/johann.klf/).

- 🎓 I currently study Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/?ddaysbb13=)
- 🔭 My biggest interest lies in probability theory, especially machine learning theory.
- 🎥 I also do a lot of photography, especially street scenes, as a hobby. I also own a developing lab, so feel free to reach out for prints / shootings!

I'm best reached via discord 👾 (#jjohann). I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
